# Useful-docker-scripts
Useful docker scripts that might be acquired / learned from various sources. 

For example, even with starting a simple MySQL server docker container AND connect to it from host (localhost), I had quite some problem with all the "noises" from google searches. There is actually a really long thread about this on the repo community for MySQL, and boy, there are a LOT of discussions. 

THus I wonder why we don't try to accumulate all of those and put them together in a "knowledge base".
